<h1 id="s1-rule-based-computational-semantics">S1: Rule-based
computational semantics</h1>
<p>This assignment is a part of the preparation for the seminar on 30
March.</p>
<p>Please have a look <a
href="https://canvas.gu.se/courses/64394/pages/seminar-assignments-and-discussions">here</a> for
how to prepare for the seminar.</p>
<p>In this seminar we will look at the key issues related to using logic
for representing natural language semantics: how we translate natural
language to different kinds of logic representations, ensure
compositionality of linguistic expressions, how we can use these
representations to evaluate what sentences mean, deal with ambiguity of
natural language and finally how we can draw inference with semantic
representations. </p>
<p>In this seminar we will look at the following paper (or rather a
chapter):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nltk.org/book/ch10.html">Chapter 10: Analyzing
the meaning of sentencesLinks to an external site.</a> of S. Bird, E.
Klein, and E. Loper. Natural language processing with Python. O’Reilly,
2009. (You may leave out section 5 Discourse semantics).</li>
</ul>
<p>Optional but helpful background:</p>
<ul>
<li>M. Stone. <a
href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~mdstone/pubs/compsem13.pdf">Semantics
and computation.Links to an external site.</a> In M. Aloni and P.
Dekker, editors, The Cambridge Handbook of Formal Semantics, Cambridge
Handbooks in Language and Linguistics, chapter 25, pages 775–800.
Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, July 2016.</li>
</ul>
<p>The chapter gives an overview of key questions related to
implementing logic-based models and provides examples of implementations
in Python and feature-based unification grammars. If you are new to this
topic, you might find the chapter quite dense. However, do not despair!
The purpose of the seminar is to familiarise yourself with these and but
also to critically discuss what features of natural language meaning we
represent this way, what are useful applications of this approach and
its limitations. In the programming assignment (which follows this
assignment) we will practically implement some extensions of the models
and grammars presented here. </p>
<p>Below are some points that you may want to consider when reading
these papers:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are challenges of translating natural language to logic (in
general)?</li>
<li>Logics are formal languages each with specific properties: what
aspects of natural language semantics are treated well with logic and
what aspects are not captured?</li>
<li>How is underspecification of quantifier scope implemented in Cooper
storage?</li>
<li>How about other forms of underspecification in natural language,
e.g. lexical ambiguity?</li>
<li>Why do we need lambda calculus?</li>
<li>How can we use model builders and theorem provers (computational
tools) to check validity of arguments?</li>
<li>Do humans also reason logically - do they make the same inferences
as theorem provers and model builders?</li>
<li>In what NLP applications we would use this approach?</li>
</ul>
<p>The assignment is marked on a 7 level scale where 4 is sufficient to
complete the assignment; 5 is good solid work; 6 is excellent work,
covers most of the assignment; and 7: creative work that goes beyond the
assignment.</p>
